# eslint-config-equitybee

> ESLint [shareable config](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs.html) for the recommended EquityBee JavaScript style

## Installation

```
$ npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-config-equitybee
```

## Usage

Once the `eslint-config-equitybee` package is installed, you can use it by specifying `equitybee` in the [`extends`](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#extending-configuration-files) section of your [ESLint configuration](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring).

```js
{
  "extends": "equitybee",
  "rules": {
    // Additional, per-project rules...
  }
}
```

### Using the `equitybee` config with `eslint:recommended`

There are several rules in the [`eslint:recommended` ruleset](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/) that EquityBee style is not opinionated about that you might want to enforce in your project.

To use the EquityBee style in conjunction with ESLint's recommended rule set, extend them both, making sure to list `equitybee` last:

```js
{
  "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "equitybee"],
  "rules": {
    // Additional, per-project rules...
  }
}
```

## How to make a new release

1. Test your changes by running `npm link`. Then open EquityBee's main app repo, `cd` into a service you want to test and run `npm link /Users/{YOUR_USERNAME}/{YOUR_LOCAL_PATH}/eslint-config-equitybee`. For more information on testing shareable ESLint configs, [read this](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs). You may have to modify the service's `.eslintrc.json` file and add `/Users/{YOUR_USERNAME}/{YOUR_LOCAL_PATH}/eslint-config-equitybee` to the `"extends":` array.

2. Run:

```
npm run release
```

and follow the interactive instructions.

3. Open EquityBee's main app repo and update every service's `package.json` with the latest version of `eslint-config-equitybee` (the version you published to NPM in the previous step).
